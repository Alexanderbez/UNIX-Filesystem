UNIX-Filesystem
===============

Using linked structures and memory management, I developed a na√Øve UNIX filesystem (composed of files and directories). I created a data structure to store the components of the filesystem. In addition, the program was responsible for many common UNIX commands and operations such as making directories and files, navigating through the filesystem, and deleting directories and files. All memory was dynamically created and deleted to prevent memory leaks.
